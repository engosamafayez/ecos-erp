 * ARCH-001 — Remove legacy "in_progress" order status.
 *
 * The 2026_07_13_000001 migration already converted all in_progress → processing.
 * This supplemental pass defends against any rows that may have been re-created
 * after that migration ran (e.g. via the old API validation that still accepted
 * in_progress as a valid status input until TASK-ORD-HARDENING-001 removed it).
 *
 * After this migration OrderStatus::InProgress is removed from the PHP enum;
 * any remaining in_progress value in the database would throw ValueError on model
 * load.  This migration ensures the column constraint is clean before the enum
 * case is deleted.
