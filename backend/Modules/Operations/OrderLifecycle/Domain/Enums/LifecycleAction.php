 *   StatusIgnored               — no handler supports this status; no evaluation performed
 *   PolicyRejected              — policy evaluated and returned ineligible (product/order flags)
 *   ManufacturingTriggered      — policy approved + manufacturing executed successfully
 *   ManufacturingBlocked        — policy approved + manufacturing attempted + workflow blocked
 *   ManufacturingNotRequired    — policy approved + FG stock sufficient; no manufacturing needed
 *   ManufacturingAlreadyExecuted — policy found existing transaction; idempotent replay

 *   ShippingTriggered, ProcurementTriggered, NotificationSent, ...
