 * Manufacturing state for a single order line.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   null          → not yet evaluated (line was created before prepare was called)
 *   not_required  → manufacturing was blocked with 'manufacturing_not_needed'
 *                   (sufficient finished goods in stock)
 *   skipped       → policy rejected (product cannot manufacture, no recipe, etc.)
 *   executed      → manufacturing triggered and completed successfully
 *   failed        → workflow was blocked by a domain engine (not enough components,
 *                   decision rejected, etc.); retry is allowed
 *
 * States not used in the synchronous prepare flow (reserved for future async use):
 *   pending       → queued but not yet started
 *   planned       → workflow produced a plan but execution is deferred
 *
 * Check isTerminal() to know whether retry would change anything.
 * Check isSuccessful() to know whether manufactured goods are in inventory.
