/**
 * TASK-INV-RESERVATION-LIFECYCLE-001
 *
 * Adds the canonical reservation_status field to the orders table.
 * This is the single source of truth for the reservation state machine,
 * independent of order_status and the legacy inventory_*_at timestamps.
 *
 * States: pending | reserved | partial_reserved | awaiting_stock |
 *         released | transferred | consumed | failed
 *
 * Also adds reservation_failure_reason for human-readable failure context.
 *
 * Backfills reservation_status for all existing orders based on the
 * legacy timestamp fields so the column is never null after migration.
