/**
 * Drives per-order-line manufacturing when an order enters the Preparing status.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE RULE:
 *   This action NEVER calls ManufacturingApplicationService directly.
 *   It calls OrderLifecycleCoordinator, which dispatches to ManufacturingLifecycleHandler.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENCY:
 *   Lines with manufacturing_state = Executed are skipped unconditionally.
 *   All other states (null, Pending, Planned, Failed, Skipped, NotRequired) are re-evaluated,
 *   allowing retry after failure without duplicating successful executions.
 *
 * STATE MAPPING (via LifecycleAction — ManufacturingLifecycleHandler pre-computes distinctions):
 *   ManufacturingTriggered      → Executed
 *   ManufacturingAlreadyExecuted → Executed  (was done before; idempotent)
 *   ManufacturingBlocked        → Failed     (workflow blocked; retry allowed)
 *   ManufacturingNotRequired    → NotRequired (sufficient FG stock; healthy outcome)
 *   PolicyRejected              → Skipped    (product ineligible: no recipe, not manufacturable, etc.)
 *   StatusIgnored               → Skipped    (no handler supports this status)
 *
 * CONTRACT — this action MUST NOT:
 *   - Call manufacturing engines directly (Workflow, Pipeline, Executor)
 *   - Make business eligibility decisions (those live in ManufacturingPolicy via the handler)
 *   - Wrap all lines in a single DB transaction (partial success must be preserved)
