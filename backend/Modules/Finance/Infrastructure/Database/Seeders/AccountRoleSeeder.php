/**
 * Account role → GL account mapping (TASK-FIN-003).
 *
 * ┌─ WHY THIS EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 * │ Posting rules address accounts by ROLE, never by code — a rule says      │
 * │ "debit inventory, credit grni", not "debit 1410, credit 2120". That      │
 * │ indirection is what lets one rule set serve companies with different     │
 * │ charts. AccountRoleResolver turns a role into an account id, and throws  │
 * │ accountRoleNotMapped when it cannot.                                    │
 * │                                                                          │
 * │ finance_account_roles shipped empty, so every posting resolved nothing   │
 * │ and was dead-lettered. The pipeline was live and correct and produced no │
 * │ journals.                                                                │
 * └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 *
 * ┌─ WHY 'inventory' IS NOT MAPPED (TASK-FIN-003A) ─────────────────────────┐
 * │ The approved inventory policy keeps stock separated by class. There is   │
 * │ deliberately NO single postable Inventory account: 1400 is a header, and │
 * │ the postable control accounts are                                        │
 * │                                                                          │
 * │   1420 Raw Materials      1440 Packaging Materials                       │
 * │   1430 Work In Progress   1410 Finished Goods                            │
 * │                                                                          │
 * │ all four carrying control_subledger = inventory. Nine posting rules      │
 * │ still name a generic 'inventory' role, and RulePostingStrategy resolves  │
 * │ leg roles verbatim — it has no way to pick a class from the event. So    │
 * │ the generic role CANNOT be mapped without collapsing the four classes    │
 * │ into one account, which the policy forbids.                              │
 * │                                                                          │
 * │ Those nine rules must be re-authored to name the class role they mean.   │
 * │ That is posting-rule work, not chart configuration. Until then they      │
 * │ dead-letter: the operational transaction is unaffected and no amount is  │
 * │ posted to a guessed account.                                             │
 * └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT: keyed on (company_id, role). Re-running never overwrites a
 * mapping a company has since re-pointed; it only fills what is missing.
