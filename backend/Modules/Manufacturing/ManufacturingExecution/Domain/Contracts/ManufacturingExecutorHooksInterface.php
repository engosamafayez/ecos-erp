/**
 * Lifecycle extension points for the ManufacturingExecutor.
 *
 * Implementations plug into execution stages without modifying the Executor.
 * No Laravel events are dispatched — these hooks fire synchronously inside
 * (or immediately after) the execution flow.
 *
 * Planned integrations (not implemented yet):
 *   - Procurement Queue    : onAfterInventoryConsumption (detect went_negative components)
 *   - Cost Engine          : onAfterCommit (recalculate product costs)
 *   - Decision Log         : onBeforeExecution / onAfterCommit
 *   - Notifications        : onAfterCommit / onAfterRollback
 *   - AI Analytics         : onAfterCommit
 *   - Audit Trail          : all hooks
 *
 * Hooks MUST NOT:
 *   - Open new database transactions (they are called inside or after one)
 *   - Throw exceptions from onAfterRollback (exception is re-thrown by executor)
 *   - Perform long-running I/O synchronously
 *
 * Inject via ManufacturingExecutionServiceProvider. Null = no hooks.
