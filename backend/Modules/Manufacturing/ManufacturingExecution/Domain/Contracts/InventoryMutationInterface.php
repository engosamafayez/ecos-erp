 *
 * Future modules (Disassembly, Stock Adjustments, Transfers) will implement
 * this interface to share the mutation contract without duplicating logic.
 *
 * CONTRACT — implementations MUST:
 *   - Be called inside an existing DB::transaction()
 *   - Acquire pessimistic write locks on InventoryItem rows
 *   - Create immutable StockLedgerEntry records for every mutation
 *   - Track FIFO layers via InventoryLayerConsumptionService
 *   - Handle negative-stock components by consuming all available FIFO layers
 *     and allowing on_hand_qty to drop below zero when allow_negative_stock = true
