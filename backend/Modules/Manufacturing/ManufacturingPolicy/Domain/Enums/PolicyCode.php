 * Typed result code returned by ManufacturingPolicy::evaluate().

 *
 * Eligible
 *   All rules passed — proceed to ManufacturingApplicationService.
 *
 * Ineligible codes (short-circuit order):
 *   OrderCancelled             — checked first; nullifies all other rules
 *   OrderStatusNotAllowed      — status must be pending or processing
 *   ProductCannotManufacture   — product.can_manufacture = false
 *   RecipeNotFound             — product has no active recipe
 *   ProductNotInventoryManaged — product is not tracked by inventory
 *   ManufacturingNotRequired   — required_qty <= 0
 *   AlreadyManufactured        — a transaction already exists for this order line
