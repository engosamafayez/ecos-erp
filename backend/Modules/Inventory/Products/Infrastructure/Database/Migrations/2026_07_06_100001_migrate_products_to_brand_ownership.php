 * TASK-PRODUCT-OWNERSHIP-002 — Brand Ownership Migration.
 *
 * Replaces direct Product → Company ownership with Product → Brand → Company.
 *
 *   1. Add brand_id nullable FK → brands.id
 *   2. Backfill via product_channel_mappings → channels.brand_id
 *   3. Backfill remaining via products.company_id → oldest brand for that company
 *   4. Drop company_id FK and column
 *
 * DOWN: re-adds company_id derived from brand → company, removes brand_id.
