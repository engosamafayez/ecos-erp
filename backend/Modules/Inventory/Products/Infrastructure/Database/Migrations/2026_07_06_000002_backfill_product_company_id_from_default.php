/**
 * ADR-013 — Backfill Phase 2.
 *
 * The first migration (000001) backfilled products that had at least one
 * active channel mapping. This migration handles the remainder: products whose
 * company_id is still NULL because they have no channel mappings (e.g. raw
 * materials, packaging materials, or finished goods created before channels
 * were assigned).
 *
 * Resolution strategy (in priority order):
 *   1. Channel mapping (already done in 000001 — re-run is safe, updates 0 rows).
 *   2. Primary company: the company that owns the most active channels.
 *      In a single-company setup this is unambiguous. In a multi-company setup
 *      this is a best-effort assignment; operators should review and reassign
 *      via the Product form where the correct owner differs.
 *
 * The column is kept nullable here. Migration 000003 will enforce NOT NULL
 * once the dataset is verified clean.
