/**
 * ADR-013 Principle 1 — Product Ownership.
 *
 * Adds a direct company_id FK to products so ownership is first-class and never
 * inferred from channel mappings at query time.
 *
 * Migration strategy (from ADR-013):
 *   1. Add nullable company_id column.
 *   2. Backfill from the first active channel mapping.
 *   3. Column remains nullable to accommodate raw materials and products that
 *      existed before any channel assignment (they should be updated via the
 *      Product form after migration).
