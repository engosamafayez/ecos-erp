/**
 * ADR-013 — NOT NULL enforcement for products.company_id.
 *
 * This migration is the final step of the ADR-013 migration sequence:
 *
 *   000001 — Added nullable company_id column + backfill from channel mappings.
 *   000002 — Backfilled remaining NULLs from primary company.
 *   000003 — THIS: enforce NOT NULL now that the dataset is clean.
 *
 * SAFETY GUARD: The migration aborts with a clear error if any active product
 * still has company_id = NULL. Fix those rows (via the Product form or a targeted
 * UPDATE) and re-run.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Run migration 000002 and verify zero NULLs before running this one.
