## PKG-01 — Product Foundation

**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Task:** TASK-MFG-IMP-001
**Architect Decision:** All 4 fields from MFG-M001 (partial)

### Migration Summary

| Migration File | Table | Operation | Columns Added |
|----------------|-------|-----------|---------------|
| `2026_06_29_000001_add_manufacturing_fields_to_products_table.php` | `products` | ALTER | `cost_source`, `can_manufacture`, `can_disassemble`, `allow_negative_stock` |

**Column Specifications:**

| Column | Type | Default | Nullable | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|----------|-------|
| `cost_source` | VARCHAR(20) | `'purchase'` | No | CostSource enum: purchase \| recipe \| hybrid |
| `can_manufacture` | BOOLEAN | `false` | No | Has a recipe; may be produced |
| `can_disassemble` | BOOLEAN | `false` | No | May be disassembled back into components |
| `allow_negative_stock` | BOOLEAN | `false` | No | Evaluated on raw materials at consumption time (RC-2) |

**Rollback:** `dropColumn(['cost_source', 'can_manufacture', 'can_disassemble', 'allow_negative_stock'])`

### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/Modules/Inventory/Products/Infrastructure/Database/Migrations/2026_06_29_000001_add_manufacturing_fields_to_products_table.php` | Adds 4 manufacturing-capability columns to `products` |
| `backend/Modules/Inventory/Products/Domain/Enums/CostSource.php` | Backed enum: `Purchase`, `Recipe`, `Hybrid` with `label()` and `isManufacturingRelevant()` |
| `backend/tests/Feature/Inventory/ProductManufacturingFieldsTest.php` | 26 tests covering migration, defaults, enum casting, capability flags, factory states, backward compatibility |

---

### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `backend/Modules/Inventory/Products/Domain/Models/Product.php` | Added `cost_source`, `can_manufacture`, `can_disassemble`, `allow_negative_stock` to `$fillable` and `casts()`. Updated `@property` docblock. Imported `CostSource` and `ProductStockStatus` explicitly. |
| `backend/Modules/Inventory/Products/Application/DTO/ProductDTO.php` | Added `cost_source` (required, default `'purchase'`), `can_manufacture`, `can_disassemble`, `allow_negative_stock` as constructor-promoted properties. Updated `fromArray()`. |
| `backend/Modules/Inventory/Products/Presentation/Http/Requests/StoreProductRequest.php` | Added `cost_source` (required, `Rule::enum(CostSource::class)`), `can_manufacture`, `can_disassemble`, `allow_negative_stock` (all boolean). |
| `backend/Modules/Inventory/Products/Presentation/Http/Requests/UpdateProductRequest.php` | Same validation additions as StoreProductRequest. |
| `backend/Modules/Inventory/Products/Presentation/Http/Resources/ProductResource.php` | Added `cost_source`, `can_manufacture`, `can_disassemble`, `allow_negative_stock` to API response. |
| `backend/Modules/Inventory/Products/Infrastructure/Database/Factories/ProductFactory.php` | Added new fields to `definition()`. Added factory states: `manufacturable()`, `hybrid()`, `allowsNegativeStock()`. |

---

### Architecture Alignment

| Architecture Decision | Implementation |
|----------------------|----------------|
| RC-2: `allow_negative_stock` on raw materials only | Column added to `products` — no enforcement here; Decision Engine evaluates at consumption time |
| RC-3: FIFO cost in consumptions | Deferred — no consumptions in PKG-01 |
| RC-5: Hybrid cost as strategy | `cost_source = 'hybrid'` flag on Product; cost history logic deferred to PKG-10 |
| MFG-M001: Product manufacturing fields | ✅ `can_manufacture`, `can_disassemble`, `allow_negative_stock`, `cost_source` added |

---

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Existing products default `cost_source = 'purchase'` | Low | Correct default — all pre-manufacturing products are purchase-costed |
| `cost_source` has no DB-level CHECK constraint | Low | `Rule::enum(CostSource::class)` enforces valid values at API boundary; enum cast prevents invalid values via model |
| New required `cost_source` field in API | Medium | Existing API clients must now supply `cost_source`. Default `'purchase'` in DTO means factory/test code without explicit value continues to work. |

---

### Compatibility Notes

- **Existing tests:** All existing Product factory usages continue to work. New columns have `NOT NULL DEFAULT` values — no existing row creation breaks.
- **API:** `cost_source` is now required in `StoreProductRequest` and `UpdateProductRequest`. Clients not supplying it will receive a 422 validation error. Default `'purchase'` applies when creating via factory (tests).
- **ProductDTO:** `cost_source` has a default of `'purchase'` in the constructor. `fromArray()` falls back to `'purchase'` if key is absent, preserving backward compatibility in programmatic usage.
- **ProductResource:** New fields are always present in responses (not `whenLoaded`). No breaking change for clients that ignore extra fields.
- **product_type:** Remains unchanged. Still accepts `finished_good` | `raw_material`. No business logic tied to it in PKG-01.
