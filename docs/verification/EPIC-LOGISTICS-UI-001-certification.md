# EPIC-LOGISTICS-UI-001 — Enterprise Logistics UI: Final Certification

**Type:** Frontend delivery certification · **Status:** CLOSED · **Date:** 2026-08-07
**Branch:** `develop` · **Commits:** 11, `88134a57` → `fdc716cb`
**Backend changes:** none. This EPIC consumed the certified Logistics backend only.

## 1. Endpoint Coverage

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Logistics endpoints consumed | 216 / 325 (66%) | **312 / 325 (96%)** |
| Uncovered | 109 | 13 |
| — of which genuine gaps | 109 | **0** |

**Coverage by group — 11 of 14 groups at 100%:**

| Group | Routes | Called | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| automation, carriers, delivery, dispatch, drivers, fleet, geography, network, shipping-companies, vehicles | 179 | 179 | **100%** |
| operations | 71 | 65 | 92% |
| distribution | 50 | 48 | 96% |
| intelligence | 17 | 13 | 76% |
| routing | 8 | 7 | 88% |
| **Total** | **325** | **312** | **96%** |

### The 13 uncovered endpoints are recorded decisions, not gaps

| Count | Endpoints | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 6 | `operations/diagnostics/{system,dependencies,queue,capacity,dispatch,exceptions}` | `GET /diagnostics` returns all six sections and computes the validation report **once**. The standalone endpoints each recompute it, and the backend notes that doing so re-fires `ReadinessValidated`. Six extra calls would mean duplicate domain events on a read-only screen for data already returned. |
| 4 | `intelligence/optimization/{vehicle,capacity,route,assignment}` | **Consumed.** Called through a template parameter (`optimization/${kind}`) that the coverage extractor cannot resolve to concrete paths. A measurement artefact, not a gap. |
| 2 | `distribution/{delivery,settlement}/options` | Their labels are English. Rendering them would leak English into the Arabic UI; enum values are mirrored as typed constants and labelled from the locale instead. |
| 1 | `routing/options` | Superseded by `routing/strategies`, which supplies the same catalogue. The rest of the payload is locale-rendered. |

**A note on measurement.** The coverage figures reported mid-EPIC (84%, "52 remaining") were wrong. The extractor matched only `api.` — several services alias the client to `apiClient` — and its generic-stripping regex broke on type arguments spanning lines containing semicolons. Corrected, the true figure at that point was 90%/33. Two Fleet items and Stop Details were already delivered and had been double-counted as work. The corrected script is the basis for every number above.

## 2. Delivered Workspaces

| Phase | Workspace | Capability |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Trip Management | Six status metrics, quick filters, search, pagination, create/edit, detail drawer (overview, resourcing, driver acceptance, timeline, money), live dispatch readiness, status transitions |
| 2 | Trip Execution | Orders, stops (generate/start/complete), driver workflow, proof of delivery, exceptions, returns, live execution status |
| 3 | Settlement | Payment ledger with verify/reject, settlement lifecycle, driver cash submission, reconciliation, disputes, approval via finalize, financial summary |
| 4 | Routing · Carrier Accounts · Automation | Route plan/replan with strategy and ETA projection; carrier accounts with capabilities, status mappings and connection test; automation policies, consumers and metrics |
| 5 | Logistics Intelligence | Decisions, insights, forecasts, optimisation |
| 6.1 | Trip Custody | Add, confirm receipt, remove — completing the trip aggregate |
| 6.2 | Operations Diagnostics | Per-module readiness, capacity/dispatch/exceptions summaries, two exception-maintenance sweeps |
| 6.2 | Delivery Completion | COD write-off, return discrepancy |
| 6.2 | Fuel Review | New workspace: anomaly-filtered ledger with four review outcomes, inspection detail, maintenance reprojection |
| 6.2 | Dispatch Board | New workspace: boards, proposals, assignments with override, resource pool, board lifecycle |
| 6.2 | Network Capacity | Commitment primitives — reserve, commit, release, expired-hold sweep |

**64 files** under `src/features/logistics`. **1,815 EN + 1,815 AR** keys in the logistics namespace, at parity.

Enterprise components throughout: `UniversalDataGrid`, `SmartToolbar`, `EntityDrawer`, `WorkspacePage`, `WorkspaceHeader`, `Pagination`. Selector Mode (`t($ => $.key)`) exclusively; no dynamic-key helper introduced.

## 3. Remaining Backend-Dependent Capabilities

Four items from the requested scope cannot be built against the API as it stands.

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| **Carrier Settlement** | **No API.** `logistics/carriers` exposes integration accounts; shipping companies expose contracts. Neither settles money. The settlement tab states this rather than omitting it silently. |
| **Routing Run History / Replay Details / Run Audit** | **Endpoint unreachable.** `GET /routing/runs/{id}` exists, but no payload anywhere exposes an optimisation run id — `RoutePlanResource` omits it and there is no runs index. Needs either a runs index endpoint or `optimization_run_id` on the plan resource. |
| **Fleet Timeline · Stop Timeline · Stop Audit** | **No API.** Confirmed against the route table; not built. |
| **Capacity Slot picker** | **No list endpoint.** Slot ids are entered directly and the screen explains why. |

Two further endpoints were deliberately **not consumed as redundant**: `delivery/{id}/attempts/{id}` and `delivery/{id}/returns/{id}` return exactly the relations their list endpoints already load, as does `distribution/trips/{id}/stops/{id}`. Service methods written for these were removed rather than left as coverage theatre.

## 4. Validation Results

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `tsc -b` | **25 errors — the pre-EPIC baseline, unchanged across all 11 commits.** Zero introduced |
| ESLint | Clean at `--max-warnings=0` across `src/features/logistics`, `src/router`, `src/config` |
| ESLint suppressions | **4,833 — unchanged.** No file's frozen count grew |
| Guardian pre-commit | PHP syntax ✓ · ESLint ✓ · TypeScript ✓ on every commit |
| i18n audit — missing keys | **0** |
| i18n audit — invalid JSON | **0** |
| EN/AR parity | 1,815 / 1,815 |
| RTL-safe | Logical properties throughout; no RTL-unsafe classes in new code |
| Localization coverage | 76.24% → **77.56%** |

**IAM integration.** Every gated control is bound to a permission verified in the backend catalogue, and controls are hidden rather than disabled. Permissions used: `logistics.distribution.{create,update}`, `routing.{view,optimize}`, `carrier.{view,manage}`, `operations.view`, `operations.exception.{manage,escalate}`, `delivery.{cod.verify,return.manage}`, `fleet.{fuel.reconcile,maintenance.schedule}`, `dispatch.{view,manage,propose,release}`, `network.capacity.{commit,manage}`.

Where the backend separates permissions, the UI keeps them separate — `operations.exception.escalate` is distinct from `operations.exception.manage` because escalation commits somebody else's time, and `dispatch.release` is distinct from `dispatch.propose` because releasing puts vehicles and drivers on trips. One error was caught and fixed pre-commit: an invented `operations.manage` that does not exist in the catalogue.

**Two platform corrections** landed during this EPIC and are separately certified:
- **TASK-PLATFORM-NAV-L10N-001** — navigation labels now come from translation keys; adding navigation no longer requires a hardcoded string. Suppressions fell 4,984 → 4,833.
- **Guardian worktree fix** — validators had been checking the main checkout's files, not the worktree's, on every commit made from a linked worktree. All validators now read the correct tree.

## 5. Production Readiness

The delivered surfaces are **production-ready on static validation**: type-safe, lint-clean, fully localized in English and Arabic, RTL-safe, responsive, permission-gated against real backend permissions, and company-scoped in their React Query keys.

The consistent design rule across every phase was to build what the API actually offers and say so where it offers less. Concretely: no client-side state machines (transitions come from each aggregate's own `allowed_transitions`), no recomputed domain figures (discrepancies, tightness scores, shortfalls and forecasts are displayed as the backend computes them), and no controls that the domain would refuse.

**One qualification, stated plainly: none of this has been exercised against a running application.** Every gate above is static.

## 6. Browser Verification Deferred to Go Live Certification

To be executed in the single end-to-end pass across all modules, alongside CRM:

- **Per workspace** — Trip Management · Trip Execution · Settlement · Routing · Carrier Accounts · Automation · Intelligence · Custody · Operations Diagnostics · Delivery · Fuel Review · Dispatch Board · Network Capacity
- **Per screen** — no runtime errors · no console errors · CRUD flow · EN/AR localization · RTL/LTR · desktop/tablet/mobile layouts · permission visibility · loading states · empty states · error states
- **Denied-path permission verification** with a restricted (non-admin) user. Granted-path gating is certified statically; that each gated control is *absent* for a user lacking the permission is not, and cannot be until such a user exists.

---

## 7. Verdict

**EPIC-LOGISTICS-UI-001 is CLOSED.** Endpoint coverage 66% → 96%, with every uncovered endpoint a recorded decision and zero genuine gaps. Eleven commits, baseline held at 25 TypeScript errors throughout, suppressions unchanged, EN/AR at parity. Runtime behaviour is unverified and carried as the Go Live item above.
